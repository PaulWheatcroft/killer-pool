# Killer Pool

> Tony Crofton and Paul Wheatcroft

As a game organiser I want to:
- Set up a new game
- Add players to the game
- Generate a playing order
- Start the game

As an in game administrator I want to:
- Remove a life from a player if they do not pocket a ball
- Add a life if they pocket the black ball
- Know when all lives have been lost for a play
- Be notified who won and end the game
- Start a new game with the same players
- Go back to set up a new game with a different set of players
